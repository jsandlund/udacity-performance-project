# Plan of Attack

Two objectives:
  <!-- 1. Pagespeed score of 90+ for index.html, on both mobile & desktop -->
  2. Frame rate of 60fps should be obtained for the pizza.html page (views/pizza.html). The file you need to study and change is views/js/main.js.

Comments should be added to main.js to indicate the optimizations implemented in the pizza.html page.

## 1. Pagespeed score 90+ for index.html - DONE
- Install ngrok
- Run through pagespeed inspights

Changes
  - Optimized pizzaria image
  - Optimized headshot
  - Removed custom font
  - Inlined & Minified CSS

Questions
  1. Why does Parse HTML run twice on index.html?

## Frame rate of 60fps for pizza.html
